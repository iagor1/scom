What is this repository?

This repository contains a custom command-line interface (CLI) built with a shell script.

Features:

- The script's logic is currently implemented within a function, but this can be easily modified to suit your needs.
- This code serves as a template that you can adapt and use freely.
- Feel free to star the repository if you find it helpful!
Note:

The logic in the function might not be particularly complex, as the primary purpose was to practice shell scripting skills.
